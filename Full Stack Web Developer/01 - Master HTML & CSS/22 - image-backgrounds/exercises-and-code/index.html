      <h1>Dog Training</h1>
      <p>Dog training is the application of behavior analysis which uses the environmental events of antecedents and consequences to modify
        the behavior of a dog, either for it to assist in specific activities or undertake particular tasks, or for it to participate effectively
        in contemporary domestic life. While training dogs for specific roles dates back to Roman times at least, the training of dogs to be
        compatible household pets developed with suburbanization in the 1950s.

      A dog learns from every interaction it has with its environment.[1] This can be through classical conditioning, where
        it forms an association between two stimuli; non-associative learning, where its behavior is modified through habituation
        or sensitisation; and operant conditioning, where it forms an association between an antecedent and its consequence.[2]

        There are a variety of established methods of animals training, each with its adherents and critics. Some of the better
        known dog training procedures include the Koehler method, clicker training, dominance-based training, negative reinforcement
        and relationship-based training. The common characteristics of successful methods are knowing the animal's attributes and
        personality, accurate timing of reinforcement and/or punishment and consistent communication.

      <h1>Dog Breeds</h1>
      <p>Dog breeds are dogs that have relatively uniform physical characteristics developed under controlled conditions by humans,
        with breeding animals selected for phenotypic traits such as size, coat color, structure, and behavior.[1] The Fédération Cynologique
        Internationale recognizes over 400 pure dog breeds.

        Other uses of the term breed when referring to dogs may include pure breeds, cross-breeds, mixed breeds and natural breeds.

        Archaeology has revealed dog remains of various sizes but there does not appear to have been distinctive breeds until 3,000-4,000 years ago
        when greyhound-type dogs were depicted on pottery and paintings in Egypt and Western Asia. Mastiff-type dogs were kept for guarding and hunting,
        and short-legged dogs were also bred. By Roman times, most of the breed-types known today were well-defined and their qualities and functions recorded.
        Dog breeds proliferated in Europe during the Middle Ages 700 years ago.[2] Most modern dog breeds are the products of the controlled breeding practices
        of the Victorian era (1830-1900),[3][4] and the accurate documenting of pedigrees with the establishment of the English Kennel Club in 1873 in imitation
        of other stud book registries for cattle and horses.
